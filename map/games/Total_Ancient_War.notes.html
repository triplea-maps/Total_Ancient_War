To win Roman alliances must control 12 VCs.  The Anti-Roman alliance must control 10 VCs.</b><br><br>  <b>MAINTENANCE: </b><br> For every five units owned in a territory, 1 PUs maintenance will be charged to the faction.  Cities, walls, leaders, and flagships do not count as units toward maintenance.</b><br><br>   <b>TECHNOLOGIES: </b><br> One wall is gained for placement with each technological upgrade.  One tech roll is generated each round per city controlled.  Additional rolls can be purchased for each 5 PUs saved.</b><br><br>  <b>LEADERS: </b><br> Leaders are two hit units which regenerate at the beginning of every round.  They gain +1 on amphibious attacks.  Leaders receive +1 attack and defense from each type of allied unit present.</b><br><br>  <b>FLAGSHIPS: </b><br> Flagships are two hit units which regenerate at the beginning of every round.  They automatically add one hit at the beginning of any amphibious attack.  Flagships receive +1 attack and defense from each type of allied ship present.</b><br><br>  <b>WALLS: </b><br> Walls are two hit units which regenerate at the beginning of every round.  Walls give 2 allied non-missile units a -1 defensive penalty, and give 2 allied missile units a +1 defensive bonus.  Catapults receive a +2 attack bonus in any terrain which had at least one wall present at the beginning of the game round.  Each wall enables one 3d6 first strike roll on defense versus one non-missile enemy unit.</b><br><br>  <b>BARBARIANS: </b><br> Four barbarian strongholds exist, protected by walls.  Each stronghold generates 1 free barbarian per game round until destroyed.  Barbarians may pass through neutral territories, and will return original neutral territories when captured.</b><br><br>  <b>MAP CONNECTIONS: </b><br> Parhia owned East territory connects around the water with Cryopolis to the South.  Travel between Sea Zone 70 and 71 is allowed only when Byzantium and Nicaea are alliance controlled.  Byzantium and Nicaea have a normal land connection. </b><br><br>  <b>FIRST STRIKE: </b><br> Walls and ships have 1st strike capability.  First strikes are a bonus attack/defense roll which only occurs before the first round of combat. The number of rolls is limited by the number of attacking units of the type rolling and by the total number of eligible targets present.  The number of rolls granted is the lesser of the two.   </b><br><br>  <b>UNIT SUPPORT: </b><br> Some units give or receive support.  A catapult, for example, gives 3x support.  This means three eligible units can receive +1 attack and +1 defense when an allied catapult is present.  Units eligible to be supported cannot receive more than +1 from support.  If five warelephants and two catapults are defending with ten skirmishers and one phalanx: the phalanx receives +1 defense, the skirmishers are ineligible for support, and fifteen of sixteen supporting bonuses go unused.   </b><br><br>   </b><br>   <b>ABOUT THE MAP: </b> Version 1.0.0 redesigned by Zim Xero, Peter_the_Grate, and Ice, for optimum PvP gameplay from 230 - 170 BC.     Based on 270 BC, created by Doctor Che, as reskinned by Hepster and Veqryn.     The map was originally made from a pre WW2 (1936) map but it is cut and      edited to suit 170BC era. Territory names are based on citys at the time give or      take 500 years (not easy finding names to all).   Special thanks to other TripleA ancient era game makers for unit graphic contributions, and to Veqryn for his work on the TripleA engine.<br>     <br>     <br>     </html>
